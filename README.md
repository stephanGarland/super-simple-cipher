# super-simple-cipher
Please don't use this for anything beyond notes to your paramour.

Created to satisfy own curiosity for a class on distributed security. Substitution cipher using 1-indexed(char) + secret_num % len(alphabet).

Strips all numbers, punctuation, and whitespace. Probably can still break, I didn't spend much time on this.
